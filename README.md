# bus-route-problem
The bus route data file provided by the bus provider contains a list of bus routes. These routes consist of an unique identifier and a list of stations (also just unique identifiers). A bus route connects its list of stations.  A micro service is able to answer whether there is a bus route providing a direct connection between two given stations.
